"# treadwell-droid" 

This set of programs turns your Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno into a powerhouse to operate as a cool little droid. This stuff could probably be done in a much easier and compact way with dedicated parts, but this is what I came up with. 

Using pygame and nanpy, the Raspberry Pi is able to act like the brain and face, making a face and sending messages to the muscle, the Arduino. The RPi tells the Arduino what to do, just so I can use more PWM outputs to control the motors.

idek what is going on anymore with this thing
